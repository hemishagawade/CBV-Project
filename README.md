# CBV CRUD Operations Project
Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Class-Based Views (CBVs) in Django. CBVs are an alternative approach to function-based views, providing a more object-oriented way to handle HTTP requests and responses.

Overview

Class-Based Views (CBVs) in Django allow developers to organize views into classes, providing a more structured and reusable approach compared to function-based views. CBVs promote code reusability, readability, and maintainability by encapsulating related functionalities into class methods.

In this project, we utilize CBVs to implement CRUD operations for managing resources in a Django application. The CRUD operations include:

Create: Adding new resources to the system.

Read: Retrieving existing resources from the system.

Update: Modifying existing resources in the system.

Delete: Removing resources from the system.
